<h1 align="center">OPC/UA</h1>

A native Go implementation of the OPC/UA Binary Protocol.

We support the current and previous major Go release.
See below for a list of [Tested Platforms](#tested-platforms) and [Supported Features](#supported-features).

## Quickstart

```sh
# install library
go get -u github.com/gopcua/opcua

# get current date and time 'ns=0;i=2258'
go run examples/datetime/datetime.go -endpoint opc.tcp://localhost:4840

# read the server version
go run examples/read/read.go -endpoint opc.tcp://localhost:4840 -node 'ns=0;i=2261'

# get the current date time using different security and authentication modes
go run examples/crypto/*.go -endpoint opc.tcp://localhost:4840 -cert path/to/cert.pem -key path/to/key.pem -sec-policy Basic256 -sec-mode SignAndEncrypt

# checkout examples/ for more examples...
```

### Projects using gopcua

`gopcua` is not only utilized in production environments, but it also serves as a critical component in other larger projects. Here are some projects that rely on `gopcua` for their functionality:

- [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf): This plugin-driven server agent is used for collecting and sending metrics. It leverages `gopcua` to extract data from OPC-UA servers and insert it into InfluxDB. Telegraf supports both polling and subscribing methods for data acquisition.
- [benthos-umh](https://github.com/united-manufacturing-hub/benthos-umh): This project is built upon the [benthos](https://github.com/benthosdev/benthos) stream-processing framework. It utilizes `gopcua` to extract data from OPC-UA servers and forwards the information to MQTT or Kafka brokers. benthos-umh currently supports polling for data collection.

## Disclaimer

We are still actively working on this project and the APIs will change.

However, you can safely assume that we are aiming to make the APIs as
stable as possible since the code is in use in several large scale
production environments.

The [Current State](https://github.com/gopcua/opcua/wiki/Current-State) was moved
to the [Wiki](https://github.com/gopcua/opcua/wiki).

## Your Help is Appreciated

If you are looking for ways to contribute you can

 * test the high-level client against real OPC/UA servers
 * add functions to the client or tell us which functions you need for `gopcua` to be useful
 * work on the security layer, server and other components
 * and last but not least, file issues, review code and write/update documentation

Also, if the library is already useful please spread the word as a motivation.

## Tested Platforms

`gopcua` is run in production by several companies and with different equipment.
The table below is an incomplete list of where and how `gopcua` is used to provide
some guidance on the level of testing.

We would be happy if you can add your equipment to the list. Just open a PR :)
